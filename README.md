# 🦾 Skid6x6 Mobile Robot - ROS 2 Package

## Overview

This project contains a complete **ROS 2 (Humble/Foxy)** setup for a **6x6 skid-steer mobile robot** — including URDF modeling, sensor integration, SLAM, and Navigation Stack (Nav2).  
It simulates and navigates a 6-wheel differential-drive robot in Gazebo and RViz.

The system integrates:
- URDF and 3D model description
- Odometry and sensor fusion (EKF)
- SLAM for mapping (using LiDAR)
- Nav2 stack for autonomous navigation
- World environments for simulation
